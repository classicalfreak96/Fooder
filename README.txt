Current Bugs: 
	-very occasionally, loading to the choose restaurant view page crashes the app
	-in choose restaurant view, when one image is undergoing slide show and another image is tapped, the first image jumps back to image 1 in array.
	-some images are not proportioned correctly, seem to be either squeezed or stretched into the UIView
	-after long press, the map loads twice

TODO: 	
	-implement accurate current location
	-implement the detection of user preferences based on prior selections
	-make app look better:
		-rounded corners?
		-opening loading screen?
		-have image appear under the current image being swiped?
		-image “bounces” after swiping previous image away
	-implement reviews and rating
	-make previous and next button disappear
